            Binder is a web app that uses GTP-3 to recommend books you will
            love. All you have to do is provide a list of your favorite books,
            and binder will scour the internet and provide you with personalized
            book recommendations tailored to your tastes.

            Binder's recommendations are based on an in-depth analysis of your
            favorite book titles, taking into account genre, author, subject
            matter, and other factors. You can add books to your list with ease
            â€“ binder's autocomplete feature automatically searches for books as
            you type, making the process quick and hassle-free. All of your
            added books are saved locally, so you can access them whenever you
            need them.
